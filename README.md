##### Note
This is a project I created in Core PHP after two days of learning. This project is vulnerable to attacks and has some security issues. Feel free to add some features to the project; PRs welcomed!

## Instructions
Instructions related to DB are written in `db-connect.php`.
Basically, create a DB named `users` which will contain two tables namely `users` and `messages`.
Structure is specified in the same file.

## Uses
This project can be used for following purposes:
1. University Projects
2. Web Development Tasks

### Issues
This project lacks few basic things like, it won't tell you what's wrong with the registeration and login, it will simply redirect. I couldn't add this functionality because I got into some other projects. xD Other than this the project works just fine. :)
Also, you might feel that code could have been a bit cleaner. Again, it's because I wanted to try out PHP by building something. When the project turned out to be good, I decided to push it here. I hope this helps you in some way.
